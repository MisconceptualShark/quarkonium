# Quarkonium Project

3rd Year Physics Problem Solving computing project to solve S.E. for quarkonium systems

## Project Plan

- [x] Program Design
    - [x] Solve SE for specific quark mass and energy values
    - [x] Calculate number of nodes and turning points
    - [x] Guess new energy or beta and iterate for solution
    - [ ] Find energy or beta, whichever not found before
    - [ ] Plot resulting wavefunctions

- [x] Milestone Program
    - [x] Calculate energy levels and wavefns of hydrogen
        - [x] Check for (n,l) = (1,0), (2,0), (2,1) states
        - [x] Compare to analytic solns
    - [x] ![My solution](/images/Hydro.png "My solution")
    - [x] Calculate energy of (2,1) state and plot |u(nl)|^2
        - ![Plot](/images/probs.png "Energies on plot as well")

- [x] Presentation
    - beamer slide show made with notes to read

- [ ] Notate my code so I actually know what's going on
    - [ ] possibly change up turning point counter, bit innaccurate right now

- [ ] Program Extension
    - [ ] Apply program to Charmonium - need to iterate over beta now instead of E
    - [ ] Calculate beta to 3dp, using spin average mass
    - [ ] Predict energy for (1,1) and (2,0)
    - [ ] Produce plots of normalised wavefns for (1,0), (1,1), (2,0) states

- [ ] Further Research
    - Figure out where I'm going next
